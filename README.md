## Note :bookmark_tabs:

If you'd like to create your own [stickers for WhatsApp](https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/android/26000227/), you can package them in an Android or iOS app. You can publish your sticker app like any other app to the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store) or [Apple App Store](https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/), and users who download and install your app will be able to start sending those stickers right away from within WhatsApp. **Stickers on WhatsApp must be legal, authorized and acceptable.** Learn more about acceptable uses of our services from our [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#terms-of-service).
